alerts rules的使用
issue tags

## [ignore](https://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#digests)
When an issue is set to ignore, Sentry mutes the alerts for that issue. You can also ignore an issue until certain conditions are met —- for example, "ignore for 30 minutes." Keep in mind; an ignored issue will still count towards your quota.
